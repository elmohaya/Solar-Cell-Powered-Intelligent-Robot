# Solar-Cell-Powered-Intelligent-Robot

This project is about a self-managed robot that can efficiently gain power for itself, and learn simple tasks. The power gaining process
is done using a light portable solar system that is attached to the robot body. Thus, allowing it to autonomously absorb power from sunlight if needed. To make this process efficient, we implemented the Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms to come out with the maximum possible power. Furthermore, the robot is equipped with an intelligent processing system that allows it to gather data, analyze its environment, and make rational decisions concerning a defined objective function. Artificial neural networks along with Fuzzy logic algorithms are designed to achieve that. The project had been proposed for the Senior Design Project course in the College of Computer Sciences and Engineering in KFUPM. Moreover, it won the 2019 KFUPM Senior Design Expo Prize, 1st Place.

The four main distinguished advanteges of this project are:

- Ability to independently gain power efficiently and effectively.
- Ability to learn through data gathering and analyzing.
- Body Resistance to high temperature.
- Ability to carry additional weieght.
