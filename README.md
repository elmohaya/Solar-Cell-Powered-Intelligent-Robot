# Solar-Cell-Powered-Intelligent-Robot

This project is about a self-managed robot that can effeciently gain power for itsel, and learn simple tasks. The power gaining process
is done using a portable solar system that is aatched to the robot body. Thus, allowing it to autonomously absorb power from sunlight if needed. To make this process effecient, we implemnted the Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms to come out with the maximum possible power. Furthermore, the robot is equiped with an intelligent processing system that allows it to gather data, analyze its environment, and take rational desecions with respect to an installed objective function. Artificial neural networks along with Fuzzy logic algorithms are design to acheive that. The project had been proposed for the Senior Design Project course in the College of Computer Scinces and Engineering in KFUPM. Moreover, it won the 2019 KFUPM Senior Design Expo Prize, 1st Place.
